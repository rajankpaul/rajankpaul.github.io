I spent some time figuring out how to organize my online presence. The result is:  
**Static Sites + Jekyll + Github Pages = ðŸŽ‰**  
I have plans to edit the CSS, so the look of the site will change. I also want to post periodic updates about my personal projects here.
Looking forward to the advantages, mainly version control.

Thanks!
