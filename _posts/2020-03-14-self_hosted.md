I've spent a bit more time than I'd like to admit on setting up some self-hosted services, and I'm still not done. I've been learning so much through this process and it's been a great experience; I feel like I'm developing much better practices for using Linux. Recently, I've been having trouble with properly setting up ssl certificates on my reverse proxy, but hopefully I'll figure that out soon.
